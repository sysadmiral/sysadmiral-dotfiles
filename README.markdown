# dotfiles

---

Taking heavy inspiration from lots of people this is my dotfiles repository containing lots of things I keep in my ${HOME} such as my dotfiles, vimfiles, local bin scripts and configs.

My normal distro of choice is ~~"Linux Mint Cinnamon $latest_stable"~~ Fedora 26.
These files target compatability with that environment.

To install these files you will need ansible (2.3.1.0+), in the root of this repo run:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
