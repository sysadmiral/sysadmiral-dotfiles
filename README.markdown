# dotfiles

---

Taking heavy inspiration from ~~https://github.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles~~ lots of
people this is my dotfiles repository containing lots of things I keep in my 
~/homedir such as my dotfiles, bin scripts and configs.

My normal distro of choice is ~~"Linux Mint Cinnamon $latest_stable"~~ Fedora 24.
These files target compatability with that environment.
